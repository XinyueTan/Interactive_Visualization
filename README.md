## Goals of the Analysis

In this project, I will be building a couple of basic Shiny Apps and then  create an interactive visualization of some mid-term test data to convey message. 


## Packages Required
``` 
install.packages("shiny")
```

## Visualizations
### Random Histogram Generator
Now we will build an Shiny App one piece at a time. This app will generate a histogram based on random values drawn from a normal distribution, the user will be able to select the number of draws that generate the histogram by using a slider.

## Students' Skills Proficiency Shiny App
Build an interactive visualization using the data sets quiz-categories.csv and midterm-results.csv. These data represent midterm results from an open book test. The categories represent the skills required to answer each question:

  * wrangling - Question required data manipulations skills
  * coding - Question required coding skills
  * d.trees - Question invoilved decision trees
  * sna - Question involved social network analysis
  * nlp - Question involved natural language processing
  * viz - Question involved visualization of data
  * n.nets - Question involved neural nets
  * googleable - Question could be answered by searching the internet
  * non-googleable - Question could not be answered through simple searching of the internet
  * jitl - Question involved learning somethimg new (just in time learning)
  * substantive - Question involved wrestling with a complex idea that does not have a definitive answer

Here is what the app looks like:

## Background 
**Interactive visualization** is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease eith which data can be played with by non-experts. Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning as explored in the readings. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.
